# Brawler
## Project Description:

A two player fighting game based on Street Fighter developed in Python, using the Pygame library.

This game is based on old arcade fighting games where two players go up against each other. There are independent controls for each player, both with their own attacks. This base game can be expanded to add more characters as well as more attack types.

Player 1 controls are A and D to move, W to jump, R to attack. Player 2 moves and jumps with the arrow keys and attacks are with key P. These controls are customizable in the source code.
